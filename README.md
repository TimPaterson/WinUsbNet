# WinUsbNet
The WinUsbNet class library gives .NET managed code direct access to 
USB devices through WinUSB, the generic USB device driver included 
with Windows.

This project is intended for developers who are creating their own 
USB device. Using WinUsbNet eliminates the need to understand 
anything about Windows device drivers. If you know what a USB 
endpoint is and can use the .NET Framework class Stream, you know 
enough to transfer data between your application and your USB device.

You can also download the documentation as a single compressed
HTML Help file [WinUsbNet.chm](https://github.com/TimPaterson/WinUsbNet/blob/master/docs/WinUsbNet.chm)
 from the `docs` folder.
